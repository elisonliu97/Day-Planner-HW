# Day-Planner-HW

This application is a simple day planner. It checks the current time and if the current time has passed by the time in the block, it will turn the block grey. If the current time is the same as the time block, the block will have a red background. Future time blocks will have a green background. Users can type inside the blocks, and click the lock button to save their inputs. When the page is loaded again, if the user has clicked the lock button, the input that the user has previously typed will be in the block still.
